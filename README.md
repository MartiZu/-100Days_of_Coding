## Day 72
@martina_zurli
·
Dec 18

## Day 67
@martina_zurli
·
Dec 10
Day 67 of #100DaysOfCode got the day wrong last time, so here is day 67 with more testing with Jest. Getting more comfortable around it. For testing to be of valuable relevance, each test has to be appropriate and not just a simple research of a green tick✍️Good work pays back!🚀
